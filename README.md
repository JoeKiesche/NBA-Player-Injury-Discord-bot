# NBA-Player-Injury-Discord-bot


This is a simple web scraping program that grabs the injury news for the NBA games. This is usefull if you play fantasy basketball or NBA DFS (Daily fantasy sports).

To run this program succesfully you will need a server that you have permissions in, EX: add bots, create new channels etc.

This program uses a discord bot so make sure to create one and save the bot token
- place the bot token where the comments tell you

This program sends the data to a certain discord channel with the help of the bot
- Make sure to put your discord on developer mode in the settings so you can then right click on the channel you want to display the information and click "Copy ID"
